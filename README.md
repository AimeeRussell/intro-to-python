# programming skills for phd researchers (using python)

The aim of this workshop is to provide PhD Researchers with skills and experience to use programming tools for 
specialized and reproducible analysis. The topics covered include (but are not limited to):

- Introduction to version control using git
- Introduction to the python programming language
- Reading and understanding error messages to fix issues
- Reading and transforming datasets
- Basic statistical analysis
- Project organization

## getting started

If you have already installed [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), you can clone
this repository to your computer, then set up the necessary conda environment using the `environment.yml` file provided.

If that sounds like complete nonsense to you, or you have no idea where to start to install those files, you can find
more detailed instructions on [the workshop webpage](https://iamdonovan.github.io/teaching/python-programming).
